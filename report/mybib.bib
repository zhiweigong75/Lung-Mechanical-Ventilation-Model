	abstract = {A mathematical model of mechanical ventilator describes its behavior during artificial ventilation. This paper purposes to create and simulate Mathematical Model (MM) of Pressure Controlled Ventilator (PCV) signal. This MM represents the respiratory activities and an important controlled parameter during mechanical ventilation—Positive End Expiration Pressure (PEEP). The MM is expressed and modelled using periodic functions with inequalities to control the beginning of inspiration and expiration durations. The created MM of PCV signal is combined with an existing multi compartmental model of respiratory system that is modified and developed in the internal parameters—compliances (C) to test created MM. The created MM and model of respiratory system are constructed and simulated using Simulink package in MATLAB platform. The obtained simulator of mechnical ventilation system could potentially represent the pressure signal of PVC as a complete respiratory cycle and continuance waveform. This simulator is also able to reflect a respiratory mechanic by changing some input variables such as inspiration pressure (IP), PEEP and C, which are monitored in volume, flow, pressure and PV loop waveforms. The obtained simulator has provided a simple environment for testing and monitoring PCV signal and other parameters (volume, flow and dynamic compliance) during artificial ventilation. Furthermore, the simulator may be used for studying in the laboratory and training ventilator’s operators.},

	abstract = {Most clinicians pay attention to tidal volume and airway pressures and their curves during mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, inspiratory–expiratory flow curves also provide a plethora of information, but much less attention is paid to them. Flow curves chronologically show the velocity and direction of inspiration and expiration and are influenced by the respiratory mechanics, the patient’s effort, and the mode of ventilation and its settings. When the ventilator setting does not synchronize with the patient’s respiratory pattern, the patient can easily have worsening breathing effort, patient–ventilator asynchrony, which can lead to prolonged ventilator support or lung injury. The information provided by the flow curves during mechanical ventilation, such as respiratory mechanics, the patient’s effort, and patient–ventilator interactions, are very helpful when adjusting the ventilator setting. If clinicians can monitor and assess the flow curves information appropriately, it can be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool at the bedside. There may be association between inspiratory effort and flow, and this may further guide us, especially in the weaning process and when patients are not synchronizing with the ventilator. In this review, we try to gather information about “flow” that is scattered around in the literature and textbooks in one place. We will summarize the different flow waveforms utilized in commonly used ventilator modes with their advantages and disadvantages, information gained by the flow curves (i.e., flow-time, flow-volume, and flow-pressure), how to detect and manage asynchronies, and some ideas for future uses. Flow waveforms shapes and patterns are very beneficial for the management of patients undergoing mechanical ventilatory support. Attention to those waveforms can potentially improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should be familiar with this information and how to act upon them.},
